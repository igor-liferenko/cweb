Check that orig.w does not contain changes via "git diff orig.w"

First apply existing change-file to original via
  wmerge orig change|sponge orig.w

Then edit orig.w and put "xxx" in the place where you edited.
Then do "git diff orig.w" - search by string "xxx" - this
way you will see by context to which place of change.ch to
put the new change.

Then do git checkout orig.w
