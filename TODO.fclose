CWEAVE reads each file twice.
In reset_input() in phase_two() file is opened second time without being closed.
So, previous handle is just hanging in memory without any references left for it,
and closed by OS when program exits. This may cause segfault.
If this happens, add to comm-fclose.ch closing web-file and change-file in reset_input().
