If you checkout the 'master' branch of the 'cwebtest' project, the
required corrections are already in place.

Note that the various 'cweb' branches are considered obsolete. Instead,
in order to create current CWEB output, run the 'runall.sh' script,
switch to the resulting 'runall-whatever' branch, and compile the codes
with a simple 'for i in *.c; do gcc -c -I/usr/include/sgb $i; done' and
a similar loop 'for i in *.tex; do ...; done' (where you're free to add
any required 'mpost' and 'mf' invocations).

If you want to compare different versions of CWEB, use different
arguments to 'runall.sh -p ... -v ...' and 'git diff runall-one
runall-two'. This is much more impressive than my former approach with
creating and uploading such branches on Github.
