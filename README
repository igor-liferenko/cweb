The following change-files are for "cw", which is used in utf8/cweav-sub.ch:
comm-blank.ch
comm-opts.ch
comm-out.ch
comm-pipe.ch
cweav-opts.ch
cweav-tran.ch
cweav-pipe.ch

To see what "cw" does, remove comm-pipe.ch and cweav-pipe.ch from build.sh,
run build-cweb and run "cw file.w", where file.w
consists of one section.

To see what is passed to "cw" in utf8/cweav-sub.ch, redefine myprintf macro to
print to stderr and use ">/dev/null", or print to stdout and use -h -b -p options to cweave,
also using comm-blank.ch (this option is good with gdb).

NOTE: adding *utf8* change-files to "cw" should work without problems (if the need will arise)

Purpose of cweav-sub.ch:
modify cweave in such a way that if it sees section with @(/dev/null@>, it does not
make index entries for C-part of it in phase one, and in phase two output TeX-part,
middle part
and C-part from
this section to a separate file and process it with
"cw" call and replace C-part with its output in .tex file
And /dev/null-sections must not be +=, and they must not appear in Section Names.
It is necessary to process separately in order that index in main program will
not be affected by the excerpts from @(/dev/null@> sections.
NOTE: to compare what we get, use ccw - it must show that in .tex file nothing changed
except section numbers in <...> and <...>+= into <...>= and "see also" is removed;
in .scn file only /dev/null section must be removed, and in .idx file references must change
NOTE: @<...@> cannot be used in /dev/null-section - instead replace the part of material
which you want to move to another section
with "/* continued in next section */" and put it to subsequent /dev/null-section

NOTE: to debug cweav-sub.ch, apply it via wmerge to cweb-git/cweave.w and use gdb on it
