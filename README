The following change-files are for "cw", for which is utf8/cweav-sub.ch:
comm-blank.ch
comm-opts.ch
comm-out.ch
comm-pipe.ch
cweav-opts.ch
cweav-tran.ch

To see what "cw" does, remove comm-pipe.ch from build.sh,
run build-cweb and run "cw file.w - N", where file.w
consists of one section, and N is a number (just ignore ".tex"
after N in the output).

To see what is passed to "cw" in "cweav-sub.ch", use "tst.c" in utf8/cweav-sub.ch
instead of "cw".

NOTE: adding *utf8* change-files to part 3 of build.sh should work without problems
