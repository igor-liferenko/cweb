To test for compatibility:

cd /usr/local/cwebtest/
./runall.sh -p /usr/local/bin/ -v original
ctangle=ct cweave=cw ./runall.sh -p /usr/local/bin/ -v local
git diff runall-/usr/local/bin/-Voriginal runall-/usr/local/bin/-Vlocal

If everything is OK, no changes must be shown.

If you checkout the 'master' branch of the 'cwebtest' project, the
required corrections are already in place.

Note that the various 'cweb' branches are considered obsolete.
