The following change-files are for "cw", for which is utf8/cweav-sub.ch:
comm-blank.ch
comm-opts.ch
comm-out.ch
comm-pipe.ch
cweav-opts.ch
cweav-tran.ch
cweav-pipe.ch

To see what "cw" does, remove comm-pipe.ch and cweav-pipe.ch from build.sh,
run build-cweb and run "cw file.w", where file.w
consists of one section.

To see what is passed to "cw" in utf8/cweav-sub.ch, redefine myprintf macro to
print to stdout. (and maybe use -h -b -p options to cweave and use comm-blank.ch)

NOTE: adding *utf8* change-files to part 3 of build.sh should work without problems
