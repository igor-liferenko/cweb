Page numbering increases sequentially and document begins with page 1, so set
\contentspagenumber{...} (default 0) to 1-<number of pages in TOC> in .w file
if number of pages in TOC is more than one.

TODO: add to cwebmac.tex code to output routine that if last page is not numbered 0,
give warning
TODO: check what will be if there are two pages with the same \pageno
in a document
