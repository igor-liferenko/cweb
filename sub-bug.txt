When myprintf macro is redefined as in README, "cweave -bhp sub-bug" gives this:

@ @(/dev/null@>=
#define configure UECONX |= 1 << EPEN; UECFG1X = (1 << EPSIZE1) | (1 << ALLOC) @t @[;@]

Also, this happens:

@t\hskip2.5pt@> @=PROGMEM@> = { @t\1@> @/
@t @=PROGMEM@> = { @t @/

CONCLUSION: in cweav-sub.ch there is some code that when it sees @t it starts skipping

see NOTE at the end of README how to debug cweav-sub.ch
