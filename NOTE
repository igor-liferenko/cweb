"@ %" was conceived to make "@\n" start new section without introducing \Y

This was necessary to avoid (somewhat ugly) constructs like this:
@ @d ...
@d ...
and use this instead:
@
@d ...
@d ...

On the one hand, empty lines must be output as-is*, but on the other hand they influence
on output like here:
@ %

@c
whereas in this case everything would be perfect:
@ %
@c

So, we cannot gobble space after "@ " in an empty section if "@..." does not follow it.

And so as there is no point in this "@ %" construct, the commit 68de30df735a227dd4fe3438ba1e7b574b901a5f was made.

* - See this in cweave.w:

@ When we are copying \TEX/ source material, we retain line breaks
that occur in the input, except that an empty line is not
output when the \TEX/ source line was nonempty. For example, a line
of the \TEX/ file that contains only an index cross-reference entry
will not be copied.
