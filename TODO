remove @+ from @+else in cweave.w and ctangle.w
(only to check that parsing works OK - after that revert back)

remove C++ keywords "new" and "delete"

make this example work in cweave:
@ @d eprintf(...) fprintf(stderr, __VA_ARGS__)

make in the following examples that space will be added before `L' in ctangle:
@ @c return L'\0';
@ @c case L'\0':
@ @c wprintf(PROG_NAME L"version 0.1\n");
and understand how newline is preserved in ctangle if it is used before `L' in these examples
(NOTE: in this case whitespace before L is not needed: L"two"L"strings")

at value 127 of hash_size cweave works OK, at value 113 it breaks in
@<Look for matches for new name among...@>=, because of Segmentation fault

see how in ~/goweb/ is solved the problem of sorting the index for unicode (256-slot bucket;
also, 'translit[][]' certainly should _not_ be extended in the first
index to 'uint32_t' for this - instead, a thin matrix with just the '@l'
replacements for multi-byte entries should be used)

why wmerge does not have limitation on input line length? (unlike cweave/ctangle)
----------
understand why "@s ... int" in /dev/null section
influences |...| if it is used in another section - see receive.w
