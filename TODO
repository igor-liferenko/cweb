remove @+ from @+else in cweave.w and ctangle.w
(only to check that parsing works OK - after that revert back)

remove C++ keywords "new" and "delete"

make this example work in cweave:
@ @d eprintf(...) fprintf(stderr, __VA_ARGS__)

make in the following examples that space will be added before `L' in ctangle:
@ @c return L'\0';
@ @c case L'\0':
@ @c wprintf(PROG_NAME L"version 0.1\n");
and understand how newline is preserved in ctangle if it is used before `L' in these examples
(NOTE: in this case whitespace before L is not needed: L"two"L"strings")

at value 127 of hash_size cweave works OK, at value 113 it breaks in
@<Look for matches for new name among...@>=, because of Segmentation fault

remove special processing of '->', '::', '.*', '->*' as in commit 8d510b989190b313e3c07bae54151e933d9b3b44 and 49cd5dec3241e80835bbb15479acb6fb9b5dd4b9 in goweb repo

-------------------

TODO: find out which productions are applied in this example

  @ @c @2
  typedef uint32_t pixel_t;

and why it does not print "\&{typedef} \&{uint32\_t} \&{pixel\_t}",
as it is done for "typedef short boolean;"

Then check the following example and fix it too if second pixel_t will not be bold:

  @ @c @2
  typedef uint32_t pixel_t;
  void main(void)
  {
    int x = sizeof(pixel_t);
  }

------------------------------------------

change 'sizeof (' to 'sizeof @[@](' - find via grep -r --exclude-dir=.git 'sizeof (' 0000-git
and the same concerns cast if it precedes parentheses - see ~/pcm/generate-tone.w for an example
(because sizeof and (type) are operators, so there _should_ be a space after them, and because
if an ordinary variable follows sizeof and cast there is a space)
And add @[@] for "sizeof" and "(cast)" in ~/uni/.

Compare .tex output with and without (...), e.g.:
  @ @c
  sizeof var;
with
  @ @s type int
  @c
  sizeof (type);
and for cast:
  @ @c
  (int) var;
and
  @ @c
  x = (char)~(1<<7);
with
  @ @c
  (int) (var1+var2);
