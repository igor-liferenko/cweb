remove @+ from @+else in cweave.w and ctangle.w
(only to check that parsing works OK - after that revert back)

remove C++ keywords "new" and "delete"

make this example work in cweave:
@ @d eprintf(...) fprintf(stderr, __VA_ARGS__)

make in the following examples that space will be added before `L' in ctangle:
@ @c return L'\0';
@ @c case L'\0':
@ @c wprintf(PROG_NAME L"version 0.1\n");
and understand how newline is preserved in ctangle if it is used before `L' in these examples
(NOTE: in this case whitespace before L is not needed: L"two"L"strings")

at value 127 of hash_size cweave works OK, at value 113 it breaks in
@<Look for matches for new name among...@>=, because of Segmentation fault

read goweave.pdf how grammar parsing is implemented there (maybe also see gowebman.pdf)

TODO: find out which productions are applied in this example

  @ @c
  typedef uint32_t pixel_t;

and why it does not print "\&{typedef} \&{uint32\_t} \&{pixel\_t}",
as it is done for "typedef short boolean;"
